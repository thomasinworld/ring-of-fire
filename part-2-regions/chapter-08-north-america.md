# Chapter 6: North America - From Alaska to Mexico

## Diverse Volcanic Landscapes

North America hosts approximately 209 Ring of Fire volcanoes, plus several unique volcanic systems outside the Ring. From the frozen peaks of Alaska to the tropical volcanoes of Central America, and from the iconic Cascades to the supervolcano beneath Yellowstone, this continent offers extraordinary volcanic diversity.
