# Chapter 9: Africa and Middle East - Rifts and Hotspots

## Where a Continent Splits

Africa hosts one of Earth's most spectacular tectonic phenomena: a continent in the process of splitting apart. The East African Rift System showcases how divergent plate boundaries create volcanoes, and it's doing so on dry land where we can watch it happen.

## The East African Rift System

**~100 volcanoes** • **6,000+ km rift system** • **Continent in the process of breaking apart**

### The Tectonic Setting

The East African Rift is a developing divergent plate boundary where the African Plate is splitting into two:
1. **Nubian Plate** (western)
2. **Somali Plate** (eastern)

The rift consists of two branches:
- **Eastern Rift**: Running through Ethiopia, Kenya, Tanzania
- **Western Rift**: Through Uganda, Rwanda, Democratic Republic of Congo, Tanzania

In tens of millions of years, East Africa will split completely, creating a new ocean.

### Why Volcanoes Form Here

As the rift pulls apart:
1. Crust thins and stretches
2. Pressure on mantle decreases
3. Mantle rock melts
4. Magma rises to fill the gap
5. Volcanoes erupt

This is the **same process that creates mid-ocean ridges**, but happening on land.

## Ethiopia: The Rift's Volcanic Heart

**~60 active volcanoes** • **Most in Africa**

Ethiopia sits at the junction of three diverging plates (African, Somali, Arabian), creating the **Afar Triple Junction**—one of the most volcanically and tectonically active places on Earth.

### Notable Ethiopian Volcanoes

#### Erta Ale
**Location**: Afar Depression
**Elevation**: 613 m (but below sea level in a depression)
**Status**: Continuously active

One of the world's most remarkable volcanoes:

- **Permanent lava lake** in summit crater
- One of only ~8 persistent lava lakes on Earth
- **Accessible**: Can camp on the crater rim
- Extreme environment: Afar Depression is one of the hottest places on Earth (50°C+ in summer)
- Part of the Danakil Depression—one of Earth's lowest and most alien landscapes

**Adventure**: Multi-day expedition to witness the lava lake (challenging due to heat, remoteness, and security concerns)

#### Dabbahu
**Location**: Afar
**Status**: Active

- 2005 eruption opened a **60 km long crack** in just days
- Demonstrated continental rifting in real-time
- Scientists witnessed how continents break apart

#### Ale Bagu
**Location**: Afar
**Status**: Active

- Part of Erta Ale volcanic range
- Persistent fumarolic activity
- Remote desert location

#### Fentale
**Location**: Central Ethiopia (Main Ethiopian Rift)
**Elevation**: 2,007 m
**Status**: Active

- Lava lake eruptions in historical times
- Obsidian flows
- Geothermal activity

### Additional Ethiopian Volcanoes (Brief Mentions)

**Afar Region**: Dalaffilla, Manda Hararo, Nabro, Dubbi, Ayelu
**Main Ethiopian Rift**: Kone, Boseti-Bericha, Tullu Moje, Gedemsa, Corbetti
**Other**: Dama Ali, Gada Ale, Alayta, Dabbayra

### The Afar Depression: Earth's Newest Ocean

The Afar Depression is where the rift is most advanced:
- **Below sea level** in places
- Actively opening: several cm per year
- Will eventually flood with seawater as the rift continues
- Extremely hot, dry, and hostile
- Contains active volcanoes, salt deposits, and unique geology

## Kenya and Tanzania: The Classic Rift Volcanoes

### Mount Kilimanjaro (Tanzania)
**Location**: Northern Tanzania, near Kenya border
**Elevation**: 5,895 m (Africa's highest peak)
**Status**: Dormant (last major eruption ~360,000 years ago, but fumarolic activity)

Africa's most iconic volcano:

- **Three volcanic cones**: Kibo (highest), Mawenzi, Shira
- **Glaciers at the equator** (rapidly retreating due to climate change)
- Not part of an oceanic subduction zone—formed due to rifting
- **Popular climb**: ~50,000 attempts annually
- Non-technical but challenging due to altitude
- **Concern**: Glaciers may completely disappear by 2030s

#### The Snows of Kilimanjaro
Ernest Hemingway's famous story highlighted the glaciers, which have lost ~85% of their ice since 1912. Climate change is erasing one of Africa's most distinctive features.

### Mount Kenya (Kenya)
**Elevation**: 5,199 m (second-highest in Africa)
**Status**: Extinct

- Extinct volcano with eroded peaks
- Glaciers and rock climbing
- UNESCO World Heritage Site

### Mount Meru (Tanzania)
**Location**: Near Arusha
**Elevation**: 4,566 m
**Status**: Active (last eruption ~1910)

- **Horseshoe crater** from flank collapse
- Popular acclimatization climb before Kilimanjaro
- Spectacular views of Kilimanjaro

### Ol Doinyo Lengai (Tanzania)
**Location**: Northern Tanzania
**Elevation**: 2,962 m

The world's most unique volcano:

- **Only volcano that erupts natrocarbonatite lava**
- Lava is black when molten (~510°C, coolest lava on Earth)
- Turns white after cooling (looks like snow)
- Contains almost no silicon
- Extremely fluid lava
- Sacred to the Maasai people ("Mountain of God")

**Adventure**: Can climb to active crater (challenging, steep scree)

### Oldoinyo Lengai Chemistry

Most lava is silicate-based (basalt, andesite, rhyolite). Lengai's lava is carbonate-based, giving it unique properties:
- Erupts at ~510°C (vs. 700-1,200°C for silicate lavas)
- Extremely runny
- Weathers quickly (turns to powder in rain)
- Contains rare minerals

## Why African Volcanoes Are Unique

### Continental Rifting
Africa provides the best on-land example of how continents break apart and new oceans form. We can study processes that usually occur underwater.

### Lava Lake Concentration
Africa hosts several of the world's persistent lava lakes:
- **Nyiragongo** (DRC): Largest
- **Erta Ale** (Ethiopia): Most accessible
- **Mount Erebus** (Antarctica): Southernmost

### Unique Chemistry
- **Ol Doinyo Lengai**: Only active carbonatite volcano

### Accessible Rift Volcanism
The East African Rift shows divergent boundary volcanism on dry land—you can watch a continent splitting.

### Extreme Environments
African volcanoes exist in some of Earth's most challenging environments:
- **Afar Depression**: One of the hottest places on Earth
- **Kilimanjaro**: Glaciers at the equator
- **Nyiragongo**: Active lava lake near major city

## Cultural Significance

African volcanoes are deeply sacred:
- **Kilimanjaro**: Sacred to local peoples
- **Ol Doinyo Lengai**: Sacred to Maasai
- **Virunga volcanoes**: Critical habitat for mountain gorillas

## Challenges and Conservation

Many African volcanoes face unique challenges:
- **Conflict zones**: Nyiragongo in war-affected region
- **Poverty**: Limited monitoring and evacuation resources
- **Rapid population growth**: More people at risk
- **Conservation**: Balancing protection of volcanic ecosystems with human needs

Yet African volcanoes offer some of the most spectacular volcanic experiences on Earth—from watching Nyiragongo's lava lake glow in the night to witnessing the otherworldly landscape of Erta Ale's permanent lava lake in the Danakil Depression.
