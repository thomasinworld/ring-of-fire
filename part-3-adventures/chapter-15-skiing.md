# Chapter 13: Volcano Skiing and Snowboarding

## Fire and Ice: The Ultimate Combination

Skiing on an active volcano combines two seemingly incompatible elements: snow and fire. The contrast creates unique experiences—skiing within sight of glowing lava, riding down slopes that might erupt, or making turns on glaciers that cloak mountains of molten rock. Volcano skiing ranges from world-class resorts to extreme backcountry descents that few will ever experience.

## Why Ski Volcanoes?

### The Unique Appeal

1. **Dramatic terrain**: Volcanic peaks create steep, consistent fall lines
2. **Consistent snow**: High altitude often means reliable snowpack
3. **Spectacular views**: Summit craters, neighboring volcanoes, ocean views
4. **The thrill**: Knowing you're skiing on an active geological force
5. **Geothermal perks**: Hot springs après-ski
6. **Year-round options**: Some volcanoes hold snow into summer or year-round
7. **The ultimate juxtaposition**: Ice and fire in one experience

## Year-Round Volcano Skiing

### Summer/Year-Round Options

2. **Mount Ruapehu (New Zealand)**: June-November (SH winter)
3. **Chilean volcanoes**: June-October (SH winter)
4. **Ecuadorian volcanoes**: Year-round on high glaciers (though limited)

## Volcanic Hazards for Skiers

### Eruptions
- Lava flows: Usually slow enough to avoid
- Pyroclastic flows: Deadly, move at 100+ km/h
- Ash fall: Can make breathing difficult
- Volcanic bombs: Ejected rock fragments

**Mitigation**: Check volcanic activity alerts, know evacuation routes, ski with guides who monitor activity

### Terrain Hazards
- **Fumaroles**: Hot gas vents can melt snow, creating hidden holes
- **Lava tubes**: Snow-covered holes
- **Unstable volcanic rock**: Rockfall hazard
- **Volcanic ash**: Makes snow heavy and slow

### Environmental Hazards
- **Altitude**: Many volcano ski objectives exceed 3,000-4,000 m
- **Weather**: Volcanoes create their own weather systems
- **Glaciers**: Crevasses, seracs, ice fall
- **Remote locations**: Rescue difficult or impossible

## The Ultimate Contrast

Skiing on volcanoes embodies one of nature's most compelling contrasts: the ice and snow of winter sports overlaying mountains of fire. Whether you're making turns on a groomed run as a volcano erupts above, skiing down from 6,000 m on an equatorial glacier, or descending into the crater blasted by Mount St. Helens, volcano skiing offers experiences found nowhere else on Earth.

The combination of alpine beauty, geological wonder, and often uncrowded slopes makes volcano skiing a unique niche in ski culture. And after a long day on volcanic slopes, there's nothing quite like soaking in a geothermal hot spring, warming your muscles with heat from the same volcanic system you just skied.
