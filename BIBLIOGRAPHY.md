## Data Collection Period

Primary research and data compilation: December 2024 - December 2025

Information reflects the most current available data as of the publication date. Volcanic activity is dynamic; readers should consult real-time monitoring sources for current conditions before visiting any volcano.

## Verification

All quantitative data (volcano counts, eruption frequencies, elevations, etc.) has been cross-referenced across multiple authoritative sources. Where sources disagreed, the most recent and/or most authoritative source was used, with discrepancies noted where significant.

## Notes on Currency

- Volcano counts and activity levels: Current as of September-December 2025
- Historical eruption data: Complete through 2024
- Safety recommendations: Based on current best practices in volcanology and mountaineering
- Tourism information: Reflects 2024-2025 conditions (subject to change)

**Note to Readers**: Volcanology is an active field of research. New discoveries, eruptions, and monitoring data continuously update our understanding. For the most current information on any specific volcano, consult the Smithsonian Global Volcanism Program database and relevant volcano observatories.

**Disclaimer**: While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, volcanic systems are dynamic and potentially dangerous. This book is for educational and inspirational purposes. Always consult current official sources, local authorities, and qualified guides before visiting any volcanic area.
