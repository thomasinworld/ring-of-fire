This collection of volcanic extremes demonstrates the incredible diversity of Earth's volcanic systems—from the tallest peaks to the deepest submarine vents, from the hottest magmas to the coolest carbonatite lavas, from peaceful lava lakes to catastrophic super-eruptions. Each record represents not just a number, but a window into the extraordinary processes that shape our dynamic planet.

**Note**: Many of these records are approximate and may change as new research emerges or new eruptions occur. Volcanic science continuously refines our understanding of Earth's most extreme geological features.
